## üéØ **Sprint 3 Focus: World's Best Marathon Courses**

### **THE VISION**
> **"Train for Boston Marathon's Heartbreak Hill from your home treadmill"**

Transform Runner Incline into the **ultimate treadmill simulation platform** with:
- **100+ legendary marathon courses** (Boston, NYC, London, etc.)
- **Real-time treadmill incline control** based on course elevation
- **Historic race data** for authentic training experiences

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP: Real GPX File Support**

### **Current State**: Test Data Only
- App currently uses hardcoded "test_marathon.gpx"  
- 15 fake track points with simulated elevation
- Works perfectly but limited to development

### **Goal**: Real Marathon Courses
- **Remove "Use Test GPX" dependency**
- **Support real .gpx file uploads**  
- **Upload Boston Marathon, NYC Marathon, London Marathon**
- **See real elevation profiles** (Heartbreak Hill, Queensboro Bridge, etc.)

### **Expected Result**
```

## üìã **ACTION PLAN: Next 2-3 Hours**

### **Phase 1: Get Real GPX Data** (30 minutes)
1. [ ] Find Boston Marathon GPX file online (Strava/Garmin Connect)
2. [ ] Find London Marathon GPX file  
3. [ ] Find NYC Marathon GPX file
4. [ ] Verify files are valid GPX format with elevation data

### **Phase 2: Implement Real File Upload** (90 minutes)
1. [ ] Remove hardcoded "Use Test GPX" button from GPXUploadView
2. [ ] Enhance .fileImporter to support real .gpx files only
3. [ ] Add file validation (size, format, track point count)
4. [ ] Update GPXUploadViewModel to handle real files
5. [ ] Test with Boston Marathon GPX file

### **Phase 3: Validation & Polish** (60 minutes)  
1. [ ] Upload all 3 marathon courses successfully
2. [ ] Verify elevation charts show realistic profiles
3. [ ] Check segment data matches expected course difficulty
4. [ ] Add course metadata auto-detection (distance, elevation gain)
