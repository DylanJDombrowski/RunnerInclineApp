## ðŸ”§ Current Issues to Resolve

### 1. Testing GPX Upload Flow
- **Issue**: Need to test GPX file upload in iOS Simulator
- **Solution**: Use drag-and-drop or Files app method (see testing guide below)

### 2. Edge Function Verification
- **Status**: Unknown if `process-gpx` Edge Function is working correctly
- **Next**: Test with real GPX file and check Supabase logs

### 3. Storage Bucket Setup
- **Status**: Need to verify "courses" bucket exists in Supabase Storage
- **Next**: Check Supabase dashboard

## ðŸ§ª Testing Guide: GPX Files in iOS Simulator

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Open iOS Simulator
2. Open your RunnerInclineApp
3. Tap the "+" button to open GPXUploadView
4. Tap "Select GPX File"
5. **Drag your GPX file from Mac Finder directly onto the simulator screen**
6. The file picker should recognize it

### Method 2: Files App
1. Open iOS Simulator
2. Go to **Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy**
3. Open **Files** app in simulator
4. Drag your GPX file from Mac to Files app
5. In your app, file picker will show files from Files app

### Method 3: Safari Download
1. Upload your GPX file to a cloud service (Google Drive, Dropbox)
2. Open Safari in simulator
3. Download the GPX file
4. Use file picker to select from Downloads

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Test GPX Upload Flow**
   - Try uploading a test GPX file using drag & drop method
   - Verify file appears in Supabase Storage dashboard

2. **Check Edge Function**
   - Monitor Supabase Function logs during upload
   - Verify segments are created in database

3. **Verify Data Accuracy**
   - Compare generated elevation data with known marathon profiles
   - Test with Boston Marathon or NYC Marathon GPX

4. **Database Cleanup**
   - Remove any test/duplicate courses
   - Set up proper RLS policies for course creation

5. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error messages for failed uploads
   - Add retry logic for network failures

## ðŸ“Š Sprint 2 Metrics

- **Files Modified**: 6
- **New Files Created**: 2
- **API Endpoints**: 3 (Storage upload, Edge Function, Course creation)
- **Compilation Errors Fixed**: 12
- **Estimated Completion**: 90%

## ðŸš€ Ready for Testing

The upload flow is now ready for testing! The main unknowns are:
1. Does the Edge Function work correctly?
2. Are segments generated accurately?
3. Does the complete pipeline work end-to-end?

**Next Session Goal**: Complete a successful GPX upload â†’ segments generation â†’ chart display cycle.
